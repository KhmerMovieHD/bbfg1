1
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,516
<i>No one's ever believed me.</i>

2
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:43,019
<i>I just know things
others don't want to believe.</i>

3
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:47,690
<i>Have you ever found a scratch on your arm</i>

4
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,026
<i>when you check your watch?</i>

5
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,447
<i>It may have been a cat.
Maybe it was a piece of broken glass.</i>

6
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,658
<i>But when did it happen?</i>

7
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:58,785
<i>You just can't remember.</i>

8
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,997
<i>Actually, you were scratched by a monster.</i>

9
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,459
<i>They like crawling around on people.</i>

10
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,754
<i>When they move too fast,
they leave scratch marks.</i>

11
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:10,880
Ji Mo.

12
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,467
Do you remember why you're here?

13
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,096
Paranoia.

14
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,349
Are there monsters in this world?

15
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,897
I... I don't see any monsters.

16
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:31,860
What's this?

17
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,445
A paper cut.

18
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,658
- You got it when you turned the page.
- I suppose so.

19
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,494
<i>It wasn't a paper cut.</i>

20
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:45,081
<i>I just said what he wanted to hear
so I could leave this place.</i>

21
00:02:55,717 --> 00:03:01,556
<i>Mom, that day, I waited for you
at the gate for a long time.</i>

22
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,435
<i>They said they couldn't reach you.</i>

23
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,605
<i>Where are you now?</i>

24
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,274
<i>How have you been?</i>

25
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:16,946
<i>I am working in a supermarket.</i>

26
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,490
<i>Business is in a slump,</i>

27
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,036
<i>so the manager makes me
hand out leaflets at night.</i>

28
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,415
<i>It's a tough job,</i>

29
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:29,918
<i>but I will work hard.</i>

30
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:35,381
<i>Hopefully one day, you will see</i>

31
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,801
<i>that I'm an ordinary girl now.</i>

32
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,451
What the...

33
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,204
Who did this?

34
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,257
<i>It's happening again.</i>

35
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:25,598
- Have you finished taking inventory?
- Almost done.

36
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:26,808
Slow as always!

37
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:29,852
You idiot!
I'll fire you if you can't keep up!

38
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:34,607
Get out! Hand out leaflets!
Don't go home until you finish!

39
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,457
<i>I've tried so hard to fit in.</i>

40
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,377
<i>But just now,</i>

41
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,630
<i>I heard that strange noise again.</i>

42
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,176
<i>I wonder</i>

43
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,305
<i>if there's a way to get rid of it.</i>

44
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,571
MENG

45
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,956
Sir, sir.
Are you going to the supermarket?

46
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,292
- What?
- It's closed. You can come tomorrow.

47
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,628
Our anniversary sale is tomorrow. Mega
sale! Spend 888, get 888 back in cash.

48
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,926
Easy to choose, easy to buy.
Lowest prices every time.

49
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:48,805
Listen.

50
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:51,267
I'm a hunter. A monster hunter.

51
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,520
You carry on with leaflets
and I'll deal with the monster.

52
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,857
After tonight, just forget everything.

53
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:58,940
All right?

54
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,026
Thank you!

55
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,449
<i>Sir! What monster, sir?</i>

56
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,544
It's freezing in here.

57
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,800
Take a look around.

58
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,192
We're too late.

59
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,444
Fei!

60
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,074
Fei!

61
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,160
What's wrong with them?

62
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,858
I told you today would be a good day.

63
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,944
You see?
If we nab it, we're set for the year.

64
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:30,450
- You're a real pest.
- I gotta hype myself up, all right?

65
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,037
Hey, there.

66
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,251
What are you?

67
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,336
You can see me?

68
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,464
Boss! She can see me!

69
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,547
Get over here!

70
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,591
Coming.

71
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,804
Over there. Lift his feet.

72
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,267
He's so heavy.

73
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,354
Should we call the police?

74
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:04,692
Call the police?
And tell them you saw a monster?

75
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,708
- What was that?
- Maybe the circuit breaker tripped.

76
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,048
What's the temperature now?

77
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,217
Let me remind you,
the monster will wake up

78
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,968
any moment without air conditioning.

79
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,094
You don't say.

80
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,097
Stay here. Don't come out.
It's dangerous outside.

81
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,976
Hey, lady, he's not kidding.

82
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,438
<i>As he said, we're monster hunters.</i>

83
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:47,401
The first step of monster hunting
is to trap it with charms.

84
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,863
My boss is setting up
a Confinement Sphere.

85
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,199
Don't worry, I got your back.

86
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,535
As for...

87
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,287
As for your two colleagues,
they'll be fine.

88
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,498
It's just like getting a cold.

89
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,416
Don't worry. They're fine, see?

90
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,922
No! No! No! They moved!

91
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:11,509
They're alive, so of course they move.
I told you to stay inside.

92
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,134
- Hey, did you complete the charm?
- There! It's done!

93
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,555
Get out of the way. It's dangerous here.
Lure it to the trap.

94
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:03,477
Why is it always me? Come on, fatty!

95
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,272
Looks like you need some cardio!

96
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,151
Follow me!

97
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:12,445
Keep it up! Breathe!

98
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,905
Come. Let's find a safe place to hide.

99
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,081
This way!

100
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,336
Hey, fatty!

101
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,588
Why are you following them?

102
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,298
Here! Come with me!

103
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,675
Come on! Follow me!

104
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,344
Bro! Focus on me!

105
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,514
What are you doing, Paper?

106
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,309
- I'm luring it to the trap.
- It's on the other side. Go!

107
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,101
Come on!

108
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:52,026
This place is a mess!
How would I know where to go?

109
00:10:58,824 --> 00:10:59,825
Go!

110
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,452
Jeez, it's fast!

111
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,848
Messing up the sale shelves
doesn't make you a hotshot!

112
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,416
Am I a joke to you?

113
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,420
Tickle, tickle! Tickle you to death.

114
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:16,133
Come get me! Oh, but you can't!

115
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,610
Are you all right?

116
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,657
Oh, crap!

117
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,183
PUSH

118
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:05,201
Hey, fatty. Over here.

119
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:10,206
Now you get to face the real me!

120
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,424
Boss, take care of the girl.

121
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,676
It's show time!

122
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,435
Oops.

123
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,188
Sorry, sorry.

124
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,990
I was kidding! Why so serious?

125
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,931
You're trapped now, fatty.

126
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,440
Having fun?

127
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,942
Catch me if you can.

128
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,652
Show me what you've got.

129
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:22,903
Can't move now, eh?

130
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,489
Done showing off? Think you're hot stuff?

131
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,415
Why is it breaking free?

132
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,667
What?

133
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,295
You didn't close the circle!

134
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,963
Look what you've done!

135
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:49,512
Go!

136
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,338
The girl.

137
00:15:56,914 --> 00:16:01,126
That was pretty cool,
but don't do that again.

138
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,440
<i>Now it's clear.
I haven't been hallucinating.</i>

139
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:28,153
<i>There's someone else in this world
who can also see monsters.</i>

140
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,571
Are you okay?

141
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:38,664
Now you believe me, right?
Our job is to turn monsters into crystals.

142
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,125
Paper, let's go!

143
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,168
I'm still talking!

144
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,588
Do you see monsters a lot? And I...

145
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:50,134
- Move it, man!
- Fine.

146
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,510
See you.

147
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,053
Hey!

148
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:57,016
You... What do I do with this mess?!

149
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:02,187
Miss, I told you that we're here
for the monster.

150
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,648
You should be grateful you're alive.

151
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:55,449
I have finally found
the person I've been looking for.

152
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,957
<i>Bring her to me.</i>

153
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,268
I keep thinking about the girl.

154
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:27,397
You wrecked the supermarket
and left her with the mess.

155
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,358
Should I feel guilty?

156
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,321
Call the dealer.
See how much the crystal is worth.

157
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:35,822
Sure.

158
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:41,578
Did you notice
that the Yeti kept going after the girl?

159
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,580
Don't you find that odd?

160
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,250
What's odd about that?

161
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,508
<i>Well, nothing's strange in this world.</i>

162
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,096
<i>Look at my job.</i>

163
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,974
<i>Some people catch thieves.</i>

164
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,059
<i>I catch monsters.</i>

165
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:08,313
<i>We go where the monsters go.</i>

166
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:16,530
<i>I've never asked myself
if it's what I want to do.</i>

167
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:25,164
<i>Besides, it's too late to ask that now.</i>

168
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,509
Why is it locked?

169
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,891
Did you do this?
I ought to call the police.

170
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:49,229
<i>Just at around 10 p.m., our supermarket
got wrecked by this nutcase.</i>

171
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:52,774
<i>Our boss reprimanded her for slacking off
so she smashed the place out of revenge.</i>

172
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,694
- See? They're talking about you, right?
<i>- It's the girl in the photo.</i>

173
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:59,448
<i>Her name is Li Ji Mo.
She even knocked us all out. She's nuts!</i>

174
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,867
All your things are here.
Take them and leave.

175
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,496
The room is not for rent anymore.

176
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,373
Psycho.

177
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,585
She looked like such a nice kid.
How could she do something like that?

178
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,391
MOM

179
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,322
Are you seeing monsters again?

180
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,531
Look, it's there.

181
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:44,159
A monster is following me.

182
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,746
Every time you do something wrong,
you blame monsters.

183
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,749
They say I've raised a psycho!

184
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,709
Are you happy now?

185
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,425
<i>- Do you know why you are here?
- Paranoia.</i>

186
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:09,851
<i>Sorry, the number you have dialed
is busy now. Please...</i>

187
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,941
<i>I've tried so hard to act normal.</i>

188
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:19,568
<i>Mom...</i>

189
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,531
<i>where are you now?</i>

190
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,579
Boss, the Peace Charm's been torn off.

191
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,373
Can't you just open the door?

192
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:21,089
- I didn't want the neighbors to bother me.
- That's how you welcome me?

193
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:25,177
If you weren't Zheng's brother,
I wouldn't be wasting my time here.

194
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:29,723
Charlene, have you brought enough money?
We have some real good stuff today.

195
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:32,184
Fine. Where's the Yeti crystal?

196
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,153
Where's the crystal?

197
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:45,155
Oh, no.

198
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,532
Where is it?

199
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:50,786
Damn it.

200
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,455
These are from our last few hunts.
Check these out first.

201
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,916
I came all the way here

202
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,212
for these tiny crystals?

203
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:03,840
I saw you put the crystal in your bag
unless it ran off on its own.

204
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,884
You didn't catch any Yeti.

205
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:09,179
- You tricked me into coming here.
- Take it or leave it.

206
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:14,893
I shouldn't have trusted you,
knowing what a terrible hunter you are.

207
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:19,731
- You're just a dealer. What do you know?
- You're right. You sure know everything.

208
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:22,025
You were trained by the best.

209
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,486
We all know how great your brother was.

210
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,530
Whatever.

211
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:31,076
I'm here already.
Let me look at the damn stones.

212
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:39,334
If the Yeti really showed up,
it means the Gate is about to open.

213
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:41,128
This is your chance

214
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,840
to go find your brother's crystal.

215
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,258
Aren't you in a hurry?

216
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:47,968
Come on, how much?

217
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:50,554
Hey, you! Watch your attitude!

218
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:54,057
Forget about him, Charlene.

219
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,517
Like I care.

220
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,939
This should be enough for some
late-night snacks. Money's on the table.

221
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:02,816
Only late-night snacks?

222
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:07,112
- I'm still growing, Miss Charlene.
- Too late to butter me up now.

223
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:11,116
- I'm off.
- Show yourself out.

224
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:19,457
You might as well give up
on your brother's crystal.

225
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:39,246
- Paper, let's get to work.
- All right!

226
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:18,178
Let's go!

227
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:27,645
Go!

228
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:31,858
- Isn't that the girl from the supermarket?
- Shut up!

229
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,660
Hold the door!

230
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:49,959
Why are there so many monsters?

231
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:54,214
We're running out of ammo.
Go to the other side.

232
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,637
Come on. Give me a hand.

233
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:03,972
Hurry!

234
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,393
Lower! Lower!

235
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:13,817
Come. Give me your hand. Watch out.

236
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,860
Be careful.

237
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,161
Thank you.

238
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,583
Hey!

239
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:34,712
Are you okay?

240
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,297
You knocked her down!

241
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:43,263
Don't move! I'm coming down.

242
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,981
Give me your hand!

243
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:39,318
Come on!

244
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,129
Don't let go.

245
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:03,802
You okay?

246
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:27,659
Boss, this district's hunters are here.
Let's scram!

247
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:05,780
I told you not to show your face
around here.

248
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,533
Come here!

249
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:13,996
Hey.

250
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:18,209
Miss, you don't want to go in there.

251
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:23,840
You're not supposed to be here.
How dare you try to steal our crystals?

252
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,010
What's this?

253
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,098
You use these plumbing supplies
to catch monsters?

254
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:34,392
Let's see how many you've got.

255
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:35,977
Where are the crystals?

256
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:39,188
Oh, you've got nothing.
What a waste of time.

257
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,690
What are you doing here?

258
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,443
Wow!

259
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:46,905
You and your paper toy friend.

260
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,032
Cut the kid some slack.

261
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:51,326
His girlfriend is here.

262
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:56,414
You brought your girlfriend to the hunt.
Think you look pretty cool?

263
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:57,497
Can I go now?

264
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,335
Did I say you can leave?

265
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:05,423
You wanna look cool in front
of your girlfriend? Here, watch this.

266
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:08,676
This is what you call a hunter's weapon.

267
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:23,524
You come for our crystals again,
I'll be aiming this at your face.

268
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:55,932
Hey. Are you okay?

269
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:57,808
I'm fine.

270
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:43,062
I picked this up in the supermarket.
You left before I could give it to you.

271
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,482
No wonder I couldn't find it.
It was with you.

272
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:48,692
Thanks.

273
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,452
It's raining.
Where do you live? I can give you a ride.

274
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:58,953
I have no place to stay.

275
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:04,375
My landlord kicked me out tonight.

276
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,678
What about your family?

277
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:22,810
My mom sent me to the psych ward
because I kept seeing monsters.

278
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:26,689
I tried really hard to fit in
after I left the hospital,

279
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,401
but I found that I'm powerless
to change anything.

280
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:34,614
Until I met you.

281
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:40,036
I finally found someone else in the world
who can see monsters like I do.

282
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,831
And you've saved my life so many times.

283
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:49,087
You're a hunter.

284
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,090
Can you tell me

285
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:57,845
why I've been seeing monsters all my life?

286
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,556
Can you help me?

287
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,521
Sorry, I can't help you.

288
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,525
You saw what happened.

289
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:13,903
I'm just a mediocre monster hunter.

290
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,323
At least you didn't leave me to die.

291
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:53,526
Let me introduce you to someone.

292
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:00,950
Buckle up.

293
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:12,170
Look straight ahead.

294
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:15,423
Don't stare at me. It stresses me out.

295
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,323
Here you are.

296
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:25,910
Relax.

297
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:28,287
Why the long face?

298
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:29,371
Smile.

299
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:32,250
Smile?

300
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,001
The Gate is about to open

301
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,963
and it seems you hardly care.

302
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:42,176
- Where's the girl you are looking for?
- That's why I called you here.

303
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:49,350
Do you still remember your nemesis, Zheng?

304
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:55,273
You should know
that his brother Meng is with the girl.

305
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:02,321
Look. The girl's power is awakening.

306
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:07,243
Once she learns how to control monsters,
it will be difficult to bring her here.

307
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:14,667
If I bring her here,
don't forget what you promised me.

308
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,254
You want Zheng's crystal.

309
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:23,592
If you succeed, I promise
I'll take you to the Gate in three days.

310
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,929
That powerful crystal
is sitting right there.

311
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:38,816
- I want this one, Uncle Ping!
- Look at you. Always eating sweets.

312
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:41,986
Open your mouth. Look at your teeth.

313
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,905
I'm going to have new teeth anyway.

314
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,866
Just one piece of candy a day.

315
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:49,702
It's for your own good. Here you are.

316
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:50,785
Go play.

317
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:52,747
No more candy!

318
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:57,501
- I want one, too!
- Give me one! I want one, too!

319
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:01,756
Come! One for each of you! No exchanges!

320
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,383
Don't give my stuff away.

321
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:08,054
Look at you, can't deal with a few kids.

322
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:27,365
- Are you feeling ill?
- You know what?

323
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:31,869
I knew you'd come to me...

324
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:39,794
but I didn't expect
that you would come with him.

325
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:44,673
Follow me.

326
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,176
Close the door.

327
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,138
Put on some pants.

328
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,517
Have you ever seen a lion wearing pants?

329
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:39,395
This is how animals live.

330
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:44,316
You're a monster, too?

331
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,405
What is a monster?

332
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:51,991
How do you define what's supernatural

333
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,951
and what's not?

334
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,162
The word "supernatural"

335
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:58,831
has never had a clear definition.

336
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:00,791
Throughout history,

337
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,711
monsters have always appeared around us.

338
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,922
Ordinary people can't see them.

339
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:08,716
You can see me as I am

340
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,801
because you see with your heart.

341
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,845
Most people believe in their eyes

342
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:15,639
and see only my human half.

343
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:27,985
Humans and monsters live
in separate worlds.

344
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,779
They are parallel,

345
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:33,657
like yin and yang.

346
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,743
The two worlds revolve around each other

347
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:38,537
and strike a balance.

348
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:42,458
It's natural that beings cross over
by mistake.

349
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:43,626
That is how...

350
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:48,631
monsters enter our world.

351
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,174
This is where

352
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,552
monster hunters come in.

353
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,179
Throughout the years,

354
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:57,765
they catch monsters on this side

355
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,642
and turn them into crystals,

356
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:03,479
so they can absorb the energy
of the monsters from the other side.

357
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,232
But in fact,

358
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:08,984
our real mission

359
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,320
is to send all the monsters back
to the other side.

360
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,864
Ever since you were born,

361
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:15,658
you've had a connection with monsters.

362
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:18,536
You even attract them.

363
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,621
But your powers

364
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,373
don't stop there.

365
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,375
In three days,

366
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,628
when the Gate opens again,

367
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,047
you'll receive unlimited power

368
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:32,049
because you will become

369
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:33,634
the new Guardian of the Gate.

370
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:42,476
But you're in danger now.

371
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:44,895
<i>Lotus,</i>

372
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,231
<i>the current Guardian of the Gate</i>

373
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:48,649
<i>will lose all her powers</i>

374
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,734
<i>once you ascend.</i>

375
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:53,737
<i>She will eliminate you
by any means necessary.</i>

376
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:56,490
<i>I'll arrange the best hunters
to protect you.</i>

377
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,450
I'll ask them to come as soon as possible.

378
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:00,911
All right.

379
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,496
You just want me

380
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,540
to leave her with your people, right?

381
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:06,667
Great, I'll wait right here.

382
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:11,255
I need a nap.

383
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:16,927
Here.

384
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:20,764
I've prepared two special charms for you.

385
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:23,684
A Charm of Sanctum

386
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,477
and a Blood Charm.

387
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:30,983
Use the Blood Charm on someone you trust,

388
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:33,444
and he will be able to answer your call

389
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:35,279
when you're in danger.

390
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,161
What are you doing?

391
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:44,830
Wait!

392
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:47,791
The Blood Charm can only be used once!

393
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,001
I know this brat.

394
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:50,127
I watched him grow up.

395
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,254
He's a total failure!

396
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:01,639
I'm sorry,

397
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,600
but you're the only one I can trust.

398
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:08,562
Come here!

399
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,571
Take this girl home immediately.

400
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:20,699
Use the Charm of Sanctum
and stay indoors for three days!

401
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:22,368
Now go!

402
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,414
Thank you, Uncle Ping.

403
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:33,921
You dumb brat...

404
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,675
Don't let me down.

405
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:40,761
You're back, boss.

406
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,055
Hey, young lady. What brings you back?

407
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:45,933
Buckle up.

408
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,016
Let's go.

409
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,536
Careful, man!

410
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,209
Paper.

411
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:13,669
Do you know where we are?

412
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:15,671
We haven't been here before.

413
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:18,549
Something seems off to me.

414
00:45:25,722 --> 00:45:28,308
Careful, man!

415
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:29,643
It's them again.

416
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:31,186
It must be the Dimensional Spell.

417
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:32,938
It's Spade!

418
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:35,023
Quick! Turn around and look for a way out!

419
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:50,873
What's going on?

420
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:51,956
Boss...

421
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:54,126
<i>Give me the girl</i>

422
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,335
<i>and I'll let you go.</i>

423
00:45:58,755 --> 00:45:59,755
Eyes on the road.

424
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,550
I can't stop!

425
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:03,051
Grab the steering wheel!

426
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:07,347
We're trapped in a loop.

427
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:10,309
Look, that's us 10 seconds ago.

428
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:44,510
Keep it steady!

429
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:46,803
I'm going to break the spell!

430
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:48,430
Hurry up, Paper!

431
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:02,110
Keep it steady!

432
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:15,749
Damn, that was close!

433
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:20,712
Almost there...

434
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:53,579
Exit's up ahead!

435
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,633
I thought Zheng was a great hunter.

436
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:50,552
Didn't he teach you anything useful?

437
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:54,473
I guess both of you
are just worthless cowards.

438
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:02,772
Look up!

439
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:07,486
Boss, that's your cue!

440
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:44,355
Get in.

441
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:46,023
The Charm of Sanctum.

442
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:48,443
Okay.

443
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:04,918
Paper, watch the door.

444
00:50:05,001 --> 00:50:06,044
Sure.

445
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:13,552
We'll wait it out here.

446
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:16,596
- You can leave in three days.
- Okay.

447
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,223
You want some water?

448
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:19,433
Thank you.

449
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:24,813
Where's the bathroom?

450
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:26,064
Over there.

451
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:30,152
Do you have another bathroom?

452
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:32,904
It's all right. I'll look away.
Let me know when you finish.

453
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:34,030
Well...

454
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:56,385
I'm done.

455
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:58,096
- Okay.
- Thanks.

456
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,189
You can sleep on my bed tonight.

457
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:08,398
I'll sleep on the couch.

458
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,443
It's okay. I'm not tired.

459
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:13,779
I'll just hang out here.

460
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:17,908
I'm not used to strange beds.

461
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,120
Suit yourself.

462
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:24,498
Sweet dreams.

463
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:26,374
Thanks.

464
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:29,710
I'm so tired.

465
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:51,107
When the Charm of Sanctum takes effect,

466
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,777
you will disappear.

467
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,862
No one will find you.

468
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:57,906
In three days,

469
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:01,243
Lotus will lose her powers

470
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:04,913
and you'll be safe.

471
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:06,623
Why would she come after me?

472
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:08,333
I'm just an ordinary girl.

473
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,382
Fate has chosen you

474
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:16,800
for a reason.

475
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:20,929
Keep lying to yourself

476
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:22,973
or face the reality,

477
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:26,434
<i>that's up to you.</i>

478
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,524
<i>Follow your heart.</i>

479
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:35,485
<i>Have faith in yourself.</i>

480
00:52:59,175 --> 00:53:01,303
Hey, he did all that.

481
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,930
When you were asleep last night,

482
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:07,350
he cleaned the bathroom.

483
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,274
<i>He used the Charm of Peace on you</i>

484
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,777
<i>when he saw you tossing and turning.</i>

485
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,578
<i>I've known him for years.</i>

486
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:29,414
<i>I've never seen him
treat anyone like that.</i>

487
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:38,381
You're the first one.

488
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:39,965
Well...

489
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,719
you guys have been together
for a long time?

490
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:44,471
His older brother gave me to him.

491
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:47,641
His brother was the best hunter around.

492
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:51,019
Meng's been trying to follow
in his footsteps,

493
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:54,731
but no matter how hard he tries,
he can never catch up.

494
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,817
That's why he pretends to be carefree

495
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:00,278
in front of everybody.

496
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:42,696
Good morning.

497
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:47,450
Hey, hey.

498
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:49,327
Do you see that painting on the wall?

499
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:53,081
Every time he's upset,

500
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:55,917
he goes into the painting
to see his brother.

501
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:33,329
Are you his brother?

502
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,124
This is just an illusion

503
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:40,003
conjured up from memory.

504
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:43,631
ZHENG

505
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:44,799
MENG

506
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,325
Are you his friend?

507
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:13,912
Well...

508
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:17,123
he saved my life three times.

509
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:19,209
Yeah.

510
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:20,835
Looks like...

511
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:24,756
he's finally found a person
that he wants to protect.

512
00:56:30,386 --> 00:56:31,679
Come and get me!

513
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:47,987
You don't like tomatoes?

514
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:49,905
No.

515
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,826
I used to like tomatoes.

516
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:55,161
My mom loves them.

517
00:56:56,412 --> 00:56:58,873
But ever since I was sent to the hospital,

518
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:01,209
I haven't had any

519
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:03,670
because they remind me of her.

520
00:57:07,715 --> 00:57:08,716
How did you get out?

521
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,555
I lied.

522
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:16,933
I would be locked up forever
if I told the truth.

523
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,644
But if I lie,

524
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:22,313
I can live a normal life
like everyone else.

525
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:34,117
The man you just saw

526
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,995
is my brother.

527
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:42,500
He's dead.

528
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:49,757
He used to be a really powerful hunter.

529
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,804
He always hoped

530
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:57,223
that I could be like him

531
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:58,725
and be a good hunter.

532
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:05,815
I don't think I have much talent.

533
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:09,235
I'll never be as good as him.

534
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:14,282
But...

535
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,452
he left a crystal near the Gate.

536
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:19,662
I've always wanted to retrieve it...

537
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:24,042
as a souvenir or something.

538
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:28,337
At least...

539
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:34,385
your mother is still around.

540
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:35,637
It'll be fine.

541
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,057
Just talk to her.

542
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,560
At least she's alive.

543
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:52,070
Your brother's crystal...

544
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:55,365
let's go get it together.

545
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:19,389

558

What are you doing?

559
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,943
Keep the crystals away from water.

560
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:25,121
<i>♪ You're like a perfect dream ♪</i>

561
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:29,083
<i>♪ I'm no longer afraid of the path home ♪</i>

562
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:32,837
I have never been so close
to a monster before.

563
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:35,173
But it's like

564
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:36,633
I can actually control it.

565
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:40,887
Do we have to send it back?

566
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:45,642
<i>♪ From here on
We'll have no reason to cry ♪</i>

567
01:00:46,225 --> 01:00:47,225
Here.

568
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:21,552
Quite a nice little store...

569
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:23,930
you got here.

570
01:01:24,722 --> 01:01:26,224
It's just a small business.

571
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:31,354
You've got a wide range of stuff.

572
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:35,357
I wonder

573
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:38,569
if you've got what I want.

574
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:42,073
I doubt

575
01:01:42,156 --> 01:01:44,242
there is anything worthy
of your attention.

576
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:45,410
Of course there is.

577
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:48,996
I want the boy and the girl.

578
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:59,841
So, you really did hide them!

579
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:03,094
Let me be clear.

580
01:02:03,177 --> 01:02:05,471
That girl is the thief,

581
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,432
not me.

582
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:11,769
They can't hide from me.

583
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:15,440
You

584
01:02:15,523 --> 01:02:17,942
just stay here quietly.

585
01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:20,278
Don't try anything clever.

586
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:22,321
Sleep.

587
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:38,755
NO CALLER ID

588
01:02:42,049 --> 01:02:43,760
<i>Is this Fang Huizhen's family?</i>

589
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,560
What's the matter?

590
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:59,650
I thought my mom didn't want to see me.
Turns out she's been in the hospital.

591
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:02,945
Why? What happened?

592
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:06,657
There's a Critical Condition Notice
for her. I need to sign it right now.

593
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:09,118
Hey, hey, hey.

594
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:10,202
Don't you remember?

595
01:03:10,244 --> 01:03:12,163
We have to stay in here for three days.

596
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:14,874
Spade could be waiting outside right now.

597
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:43,361
Paper, what is this?

598
01:03:43,444 --> 01:03:45,279
Boss, it's incredible.

599
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:48,324
She's summoned the Labyrinth Monster.

600
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:50,827
It can send us directly to the hospital.

601
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:52,369
I can't believe it.

602
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:54,664
Ji Mo's power has grown so strong.

603
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:56,457
I'm going with you.

604
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:57,541
Thanks.

605
01:03:57,583 --> 01:03:58,709
Promise me,

606
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:00,962
we leave after you see your mom.

607
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:03,756
Okay.

608
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:47,925
<i>Mom...</i>

609
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:51,095
<i>I thought you don't want me anymore.</i>

610
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:55,057
<i>Now I know you've been waiting for me.</i>

611
01:04:58,227 --> 01:04:59,729
<i>I'm on my way to you.</i>

612
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:17,538
INPATIENT DEPARTMENT

613
01:05:52,406 --> 01:05:53,324
Hey.

614
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:54,700
What's on your mind?

615
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:02,667
Feeling envious?

616
01:06:04,877 --> 01:06:05,877
Yeah.

617
01:06:12,593 --> 01:06:14,136
It's all right, man.

618
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:15,805
You've got me.

619
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,356
It's the Dimensional Spell again.

620
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:30,569
I'm moved.

621
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:33,572
I've never seen

622
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:35,950
anything this sweet before.

623
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:39,870
I'm here to help you.

624
01:06:40,454 --> 01:06:42,790
It's nice to meet you.

625
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:56,595
See what you can do.

626
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:57,888
Okay.

627
01:06:58,389 --> 01:07:00,474
I'll go find Ji Mo, find us a way out.

628
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:01,642
Copy that!

629
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:06,980
Hey!

630
01:07:07,815 --> 01:07:08,815
What are you doing?

631
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:12,028
I don't wanna hurt you.

632
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:12,945
I just...

633
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:15,156
I just want to talk.

634
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:16,449
Don't you touch my mom.

635
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:20,286
I didn't do anything.

636
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:23,706
I knew you'd come for her.

637
01:07:23,789 --> 01:07:25,791
That's why I've been waiting here.

638
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:26,875
Stop lying.

639
01:07:26,917 --> 01:07:28,753
She wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.

640
01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:32,715
You always blame others
for your own misfortune

641
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:36,677
rather than looking at what you have done.

642
01:07:39,096 --> 01:07:41,265
There you go again.

643
01:07:41,348 --> 01:07:44,268
All the facts are laid out
in front of you,

644
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:46,896
but you still don't see it.

645
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:52,318
You have seen this before, right?

646
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:55,529
Looks familiar?

647
01:07:56,697 --> 01:07:58,491
It's your old friend.

648
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:00,493
Remember?

649
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:08,209
<i>It's been keeping you safe.</i>

650
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:12,421
<i>It's been looking after you.</i>

651
01:08:17,676 --> 01:08:19,386
Leave!

652
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:22,973
It kept your mom quiet.

653
01:08:27,478 --> 01:08:28,896
But do you know

654
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:30,856
who's been feeding it energy?

655
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:31,982
<i>Don't touch me!</i>

656
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:43,619
Ji Mo!

657
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:32,626
Every time you felt wronged,

658
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:35,462
you summoned a monster.

659
01:09:36,297 --> 01:09:38,424
The more energy you have,

660
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:40,509
the more uncontrollable you become.

661
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:42,553
Look what you've done.

662
01:09:48,058 --> 01:09:50,936
You got angry
and destroyed the entire hospital.

663
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,646
If this continues,

664
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:55,566
you'll kill everyone.

665
01:10:00,654 --> 01:10:03,699
Who's really destroying this world

666
01:10:03,782 --> 01:10:05,951
and who's really saving it?

667
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:08,537
Now you know the answer.

668
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:53,707
I'm here to help you.

669
01:10:55,584 --> 01:11:00,297
I will make all this go away.

670
01:11:01,799 --> 01:11:03,300
Come with me.

671
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:27,783
Garbage!

672
01:11:49,930 --> 01:11:51,307
Uncle Ping!

673
01:11:52,349 --> 01:11:53,349
Uncle Ping!

674
01:11:55,686 --> 01:11:56,937
Uncle Ping!

675
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:00,858
Uncle Ping.

676
01:13:03,253 --> 01:13:04,797
Don't be afraid.

677
01:13:05,756 --> 01:13:06,882
Look.

678
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:11,136
<i>This is the Gate to the other world.</i>

679
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:29,571
Come on.

680
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:32,324
Let's start.

681
01:13:36,036 --> 01:13:38,831
<i>Your sacrifice will not be in vain.</i>

682
01:13:42,626 --> 01:13:44,461
<i>From now on,</i>

683
01:13:44,545 --> 01:13:46,171
<i>no one around you</i>

684
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:50,426
<i>will be harmed by monsters ever again.</i>

685
01:14:03,605 --> 01:14:04,815
You're right.

686
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:09,403
I am a total failure.

687
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:23,125
I've lost my arm.

688
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:27,087
Paper is dead.

689
01:14:29,548 --> 01:14:31,008
And Ji Mo...

690
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:38,974
Listen.

691
01:14:39,057 --> 01:14:39,933
I'm a hunter.

692
01:14:40,017 --> 01:14:41,435
A monster hunter.

693
01:14:45,063 --> 01:14:49,026
<i>I finally found someone else in the world
who can see monsters like I do.</i>

694
01:14:57,284 --> 01:14:59,536
<i>You're the only one I can trust.</i>

695
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:11,465
<i>I'm just a mediocre monster hunter.</i>

696
01:15:11,965 --> 01:15:14,092
<i>At least you didn't leave me to die.</i>

697
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:29,107
<i>Your brother's crystal...</i>

698
01:15:30,901 --> 01:15:32,110
let's go get it together.

699
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,458
Look.

700
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:48,377
She hasn't given up.

701
01:15:53,465 --> 01:15:54,550
<i>Right now...</i>

702
01:15:55,676 --> 01:15:57,052
she needs you.

703
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:01,222
Have you forgotten?

704
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:04,685
<i>She chose you.</i>

705
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:14,194
<i>Now you are the only one...</i>

706
01:16:16,154 --> 01:16:17,990
<i>who can wake her up.</i>

707
01:16:47,519 --> 01:16:49,563
<i>I'll use all my power</i>

708
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:53,525
<i>to gather Paper's ashes</i>

709
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:55,444
<i>and forge the strongest weapon for you.</i>

710
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:01,992
<i>Believe in yourself</i>

711
01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:05,120
<i>and go save her!</i>

712
01:17:45,035 --> 01:17:46,035
What's wrong?

713
01:17:47,162 --> 01:17:48,955
Why did you stop?

714
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:50,790
Ji Mo...

715
01:17:52,542 --> 01:17:53,919
since you were a child,

716
01:17:55,045 --> 01:17:56,463
you've been bullied,

717
01:17:56,963 --> 01:17:57,963
abandoned.

718
01:17:58,507 --> 01:18:00,842
You've always been alone.

719
01:18:06,973 --> 01:18:08,475
I know how it feels.

720
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:12,020
I've felt it myself.

721
01:18:13,313 --> 01:18:15,357
I'm here to help you.

722
01:18:16,066 --> 01:18:18,610
Give your power to me.

723
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:51,601
<i>Attention, hunters!</i>

724
01:18:52,811 --> 01:18:54,062
<i>Lotus</i>

725
01:18:54,146 --> 01:18:55,856
<i>is about to kill her successor</i>

726
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:58,900
<i>just to retain her power.</i>

727
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:02,279
<i>The evil inside her</i>

728
01:19:03,029 --> 01:19:05,782
<i>has made the monsters go berserk.</i>

729
01:19:06,783 --> 01:19:07,951
<i>Our world</i>

730
01:19:09,077 --> 01:19:11,788
<i>will descend into chaos.</i>

731
01:19:13,373 --> 01:19:14,374
<i>Today,</i>

732
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:17,794
<i>we must gather all our strength...</i>

733
01:19:20,797 --> 01:19:22,340
<i>and safeguard our world!</i>

734
01:19:33,393 --> 01:19:35,437
Why are you hesitating?

735
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:37,773
You want him to take you away?

736
01:19:39,191 --> 01:19:40,609
Don't you understand?

737
01:19:44,905 --> 01:19:46,656
<i>One day,</i>

738
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:48,158
<i>he will realize</i>

739
01:19:48,241 --> 01:19:50,744
you are a monster, too.

740
01:19:51,244 --> 01:19:52,244
Listen.

741
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:54,164
Ji Mo...

742
01:19:58,668 --> 01:20:00,504
As long as you're alive,

743
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:04,633
you will only bring disaster.

744
01:20:07,052 --> 01:20:10,764
Unless you really want him

745
01:20:10,847 --> 01:20:12,766
to die here.

746
01:21:11,116 --> 01:21:13,076
We're all doomed.

747
01:21:13,159 --> 01:21:16,496
We've left the fate of the world
to that wimp.

748
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:17,998
Shut up!

749
01:21:20,625 --> 01:21:23,044
Let's go! We're being overrun!

750
01:21:23,837 --> 01:21:25,088
What are we gonna do?

751
01:21:26,089 --> 01:21:28,592
Meng, don't give up!

752
01:21:51,531 --> 01:21:52,949
You worthless scum!

753
01:22:03,501 --> 01:22:06,671
The crystal, it's here.

754
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:09,633
You want to use it to save the girl?

755
01:22:10,675 --> 01:22:12,010
The crystal is mine!

756
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:16,306
You don't deserve it.

757
01:22:19,851 --> 01:22:21,770
You should have finished me off by now.

758
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:26,066
I really don't see how great you are.

759
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:27,192
Shut up!

760
01:24:28,521 --> 01:24:32,442
From now on, I'm the most powerful hunter.

761
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:49,041
Paper.

762
01:24:53,797 --> 01:24:55,256
The most powerful hunter...

763
01:24:56,549 --> 01:24:58,343
shouldn't be this dumb.

764
01:24:59,427 --> 01:25:00,970
Look what's under your feet.

765
01:25:09,729 --> 01:25:11,439
This is the power of the crystal.

766
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:12,834
Run!

767
01:26:23,636 --> 01:26:24,636
Ji Mo!

768
01:26:32,437 --> 01:26:34,689
I can't believe you made it.

769
01:26:34,772 --> 01:26:37,567
Seems like I have underestimated you.

770
01:26:38,276 --> 01:26:40,278
Too bad that it's all pointless now.

771
01:26:45,283 --> 01:26:48,328
She's about to disappear from this world.

772
01:26:49,412 --> 01:26:51,122
She chose this for herself.

773
01:27:16,022 --> 01:27:18,358
You've absorbed the power of the crystal.

774
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:30,703
It's useless.

775
01:27:34,374 --> 01:27:36,376
You're just a puny hunter.

776
01:27:37,335 --> 01:27:39,796
You won't last long.

777
01:27:40,797 --> 01:27:42,048
Ji Mo...

778
01:27:58,064 --> 01:27:59,065
<i>Ji Mo.</i>

779
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:10,701
<i>Ji Mo.</i>

780
01:28:27,552 --> 01:28:28,845
Ji Mo.

781
01:28:31,514 --> 01:28:32,682
Ji Mo.

782
01:28:34,976 --> 01:28:36,602
You're so special...

783
01:28:40,231 --> 01:28:42,608
but all you want is an ordinary life.

784
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:53,161
And me, a man with no talent,

785
01:28:53,953 --> 01:28:56,164
keeps trying to be a great hunter.

786
01:29:03,838 --> 01:29:05,381
We've been trying so hard.

787
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:12,472
But in fact,
we've just been trying to run away.

788
01:29:16,434 --> 01:29:19,729
Today, I just want you to know...

789
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:27,445
I'm here to protect you.

790
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:42,543
If you want to stay, I'll stay with you.

791
01:29:50,468 --> 01:29:52,220
But if you want to go...

792
01:29:54,263 --> 01:29:55,598
I'll go with you.

793
01:30:15,409 --> 01:30:18,371
Ji Mo, this is your destiny.

794
01:30:18,454 --> 01:30:20,957
You could have died with some dignity.

795
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:18,806
I'm not like you.

796
01:31:19,557 --> 01:31:22,101
You are alone in your world.

797
01:31:23,686 --> 01:31:24,686
No.

798
01:31:25,229 --> 01:31:28,274
But I, I'm not alone.

799
01:31:51,839 --> 01:31:53,257
No!

800
01:31:54,592 --> 01:31:56,135
No!

801
01:32:20,576 --> 01:32:23,704
Don't just sit there. Get to work.

802
01:32:32,421 --> 01:32:33,923
That silly brat.

803
01:32:35,299 --> 01:32:37,760
He's finally reached his full potential.

804
01:33:10,584 --> 01:33:12,753
Shall we send him back?

805
01:33:15,172 --> 01:33:16,215
Yes.

806
01:33:27,601 --> 01:33:28,644
Go for it.

807
01:33:49,665 --> 01:33:52,501
<i>I was afraid
of being different from others.</i>

808
01:33:53,294 --> 01:33:54,712
<i>Now I understand</i>

809
01:33:55,338 --> 01:33:58,632
<i>everyone doesn't have to see the world
in the same way.</i>

810
01:34:00,176 --> 01:34:03,387
<i>Have you ever found a scratch on your arm</i>

811
01:34:03,471 --> 01:34:05,890
<i>when you check your watch?</i>

812
01:34:07,058 --> 01:34:10,519
<i>Have you ever had trouble
leaving a parking lot?</i>

813
01:34:11,479 --> 01:34:12,688
<i>That's because</i>

814
01:34:13,272 --> 01:34:14,357
<i>there are monsters</i>

815
01:34:15,441 --> 01:34:16,859
<i>in our world.</i>

816
01:35:21,632 --> 01:35:23,717
It's quiz time!

817
01:35:24,301 --> 01:35:25,301
This is a good one.

818
01:35:26,053 --> 01:35:28,681
- What can you serve but not eat?
- A tennis ball!

819
01:35:28,764 --> 01:35:32,977
Another one.
What do you call a cow that twitch...

820
01:35:33,060 --> 01:35:34,145
Beef jerky!

821
01:35:34,228 --> 01:35:35,228
I wasn't finished.

822
01:35:35,271 --> 01:35:38,566
Give me my prize!
